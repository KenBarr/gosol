gosol: Solace GO API

Provides a simplified Solace API for GO programs.

The API supports the following Solace messaging features:
* Direct (non-persistent) pub/sub
* Persistent publish with streaming acks and user-supplied correlation data
* Persistent subscribe with configurable ack-mode and fwd-mode, and streaming ack-processing
* SolCache queries based on topic-subscription


SAMPLE PROGRAMS
These are located according to GO standard build practices. E.g., source for example 'Foo' can be found in src/Foo/Foo.go, and it's compiled executable found in bin/Foo

* direct_example:    Demonstrates creating a session for basic pub/sub over direct messaging
* persistent_example:Demonstrates creating a session for persistent pub/sub with manual acknowledgement and publisher streaming ack processing
* cache_example:     Demonstrates creating a session for direct publications and request via SolCache 


BUILDING

'make' compiles the gosol.a library and 3 sample programs.

./env.sh sets GOPATH and adds '../solclient/lib' to the LD_LIBRARY_PATH (and is sourced in by ./make.sh). You must source this to successfully run the samples.
